## My Ruby CLI Gem Project: The Birthday Gem 




### Overview 

My final Ruby CLI Gem Project is the Birthday Gem. It scrapes fun facts on birthdays between 1901 and 2018 that users can access through a CLI. The repository for my project can be found at: https://github.com/ktbliz/birthday

The birthday fun facts are scraped from two websites: 

* My Birthday Ninja (https://mybirthday.ninja/)
* Who2 Biographies (https://www.who2.com/)

The fun facts include: 

* Number of days until your next birthday
* Number of days since you've been born
* Your birth month gemstone
* Your western zodiac sign
* Your eastern zodiac sign
* Famous people who share your birthday
